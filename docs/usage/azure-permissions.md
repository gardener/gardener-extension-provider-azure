# Azure Permissions

The following document describes the required Azure actions manage a Shoot cluster on Azure split by the different Azure provider/services.

Be aware some actions are just required if particular deployment scenarios or features e.g. bring your own vNet, use Azure-file, let the Shoot act as Seed, immutable buckets, etc. should be used.
