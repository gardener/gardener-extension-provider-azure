# Using the Azure provider extension with Gardener as end-user

The [`core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1.Shoot` resource](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/example/90-shoot.yaml) declares a few fields that are meant to contain provider-specific configuration.

This document describes the configurable options for Azure and provides an example `Shoot` manifest with minimal configuration that can be used to create an Azure cluster (modulo the landscape-specific information like cloud profile names, secret binding names, etc.).

## Azure Provider Credentials

In order for Gardener to create a Kubernetes cluster using Azure infrastructure components, a Shoot has to provide credentials with sufficient permissions to the desired Azure subscription.
Every shoot cluster references a `SecretBinding` which itself references a `Secret`, and this `Secret` contains the provider credentials of the Azure subscription.
The `SecretBinding` is configurable in the [Shoot cluster](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/example/90-shoot.yaml) with the field `secretBindingName`.

Create an [Azure Application and Service Principle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) and obtain its credentials.

Please ensure that the Azure application (spn) has the IAM actions defined [here](azure-permissions.md) assigned.
If no fine-grained permissions/actions required then simply assign the [Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) role.

The example below demonstrates how the secret containing the client credentials of the Azure Application has to look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: core-azure
  namespace: garden-dev
type: Opaque
data:
  clientID: base64(client-id)
  clientSecret: base64(client-secret)
  subscriptionID: base64(subscription-id)
  tenantID: base64(tenant-id)
```

⚠️ Depending on your API usage it can be problematic to reuse the same Service Principal for different Shoot clusters due to rate limits.
Please consider spreading your Shoots over Service Principals from different Azure subscriptions if you are hitting those limits.

### Managed Service Principals

The operators of the Gardener Azure extension can provide managed service principals.
This eliminates the need for users to provide an own service principal for a Shoot.

To make use of a managed service principal, the Azure secret of a Shoot cluster must contain only a `subscriptionID` and a `tenantID` field, but no `clientID` and `clientSecret`.
Removing those fields from the secret of an existing Shoot will also let it adopt the managed service principal.

Based on the `tenantID` field, the Gardener extension will try to assign the managed service principal to the Shoot.
If no managed service principal can be assigned then the next operation on the Shoot will fail.

⚠️ The managed service principal need to be assigned to the users Azure subscription with proper permissions before using it.

## `InfrastructureConfig`

The infrastructure configuration mainly describes how the network layout looks like in order to create the shoot worker nodes in a later step, thus, prepares everything relevant to create VMs, load balancers, volumes, etc.

An example `InfrastructureConfig` for the Azure extension looks as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: InfrastructureConfig
networks:
  vnet: # specify either 'name' and 'resourceGroup' or 'cidr'
    # name: my-vnet
    # resourceGroup: my-vnet-resource-group
    cidr: 10.250.0.0/16
    # ddosProtectionPlanID: /subscriptions/test/resourceGroups/test/providers/Microsoft.Network/ddosProtectionPlans/test-ddos-protection-plan
  workers: 10.250.0.0/19
  # natGateway:
  #   enabled: false
  #   idleConnectionTimeoutMinutes: 4
  #   zone: 1
  #   ipAddresses:
  #   - name: my-public-ip-name
  #     resourceGroup: my-public-ip-resource-group
  #     zone: 1
  # serviceEndpoints:
  # - Microsoft.Test
  # zones:
  # - name: 1
  #   cidr: "10.250.0.0/24
  # - name: 2
  #   cidr: "10.250.0.0/24"
  #   natGateway:
  #     enabled: false
zoned: false
# resourceGroup:
#   name: mygroup
#identity:
#  name: my-identity-name
#  resourceGroup: my-identity-resource-group
#  acrAccess: true
```

Currently, it's not yet possible to deploy into existing resource groups, but in the future it will.
The `.resourceGroup.name` field will allow specifying the name of an already existing resource group that the shoot cluster and all infrastructure resources will be deployed to.

Via the `.zoned` boolean you can tell whether you want to use Azure availability zones or not.
If you don't use zones then an availability set will be created and only basic load balancers will be used.
Zoned clusters use standard load balancers.

The `networks.vnet` section describes whether you want to create the shoot cluster in an already existing VNet or whether to create a new one:

* If `networks.vnet.name` and `networks.vnet.resourceGroup` are given then you have to specify the VNet name and VNet resource group name of the existing VNet that was created by other means (manually, other tooling, ...).
* If `networks.vnet.cidr` is given then you have to specify the VNet CIDR of a new VNet that will be created during shoot creation.
You can freely choose a private CIDR range.
* Either `networks.vnet.name` and `neworks.vnet.resourceGroup` or `networks.vnet.cidr` must be present, but not both at the same time.
* The `networks.vnet.ddosProtectionPlanID` field can be used to specify the id of a ddos protection plan which should be assigned to the VNet. This will only work for a VNet managed by Gardener. For externally managed VNets the ddos protection plan must be assigned by other means.
* If a vnet name is given and cilium shoot clusters are created without a network overlay within one vnet make sure that the pod CIDR specified in `shoot.spec.networking.pods` is not overlapping with any other pod CIDR used in that vnet.
Overlapping pod CIDRs will lead to disfunctional shoot clusters.

The `networks.workers` section describes the CIDR for a subnet that is used for all shoot worker nodes, i.e., VMs which later run your applications.
The specified CIDR range must be contained in the VNet CIDR specified above, or the VNet CIDR of your already existing VNet.
You can freely choose this CIDR and it is your responsibility to properly design the network layout to suit your needs.

In the `networks.serviceEndpoints[]` list you can specify the list of Azure service endpoints which shall be associated with the worker subnet. All available service endpoints and their technical names can be found in the (Azure Service Endpoint documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview).

The `networks.natGateway` section contains configuration for the Azure NatGateway which can be attached to the worker subnet of a Shoot cluster. Here are some key information about the usage of the NatGateway for a Shoot cluster:
- NatGateway usage is optional and can be enabled or disabled via `.networks.natGateway.enabled`.
- If the NatGateway is not used then the egress connections initiated within the Shoot cluster will be nated via the LoadBalancer of the clusters (default Azure behaviour, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections#scenarios)).
- NatGateway is only available for zonal clusters `.zoned=true`.
- The NatGateway is currently **not** zone redundantly deployed. That mean the NatGateway of a Shoot cluster will always be in just one zone. This zone can be optionally selected via `.networks.natGateway.zone`.
- **Caution:** Modifying the `.networks.natGateway.zone` setting requires a recreation of the NatGateway and the managed public ip (automatically used if no own public ip is specified, see below). That mean you will most likely get a different public ip for egress connections.
- It is possible to bring own zonal public ip(s) via `networks.natGateway.ipAddresses`. Those public ip(s) need to be in the same zone as the NatGateway (see `networks.natGateway.zone`) and be of SKU `standard`. For each public ip the `name`, the `resourceGroup` and the `zone` need to be specified.
- The field `networks.natGateway.idleConnectionTimeoutMinutes` allows the configuration of NAT Gateway's idle connection timeout property. The idle timeout value can be adjusted from 4 minutes, up to 120 minutes. Omitting this property will set the idle timeout to its default value according to [NAT Gateway's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway-resource#timers).

In the `identity` section you can specify an [Azure user-assigned managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview#how-does-the-managed-identities-for-azure-resources-work) which should be attached to all cluster worker machines. With `identity.name` you can specify the name of the identity and with `identity.resourceGroup` you can specify the resource group which contains the identity resource on Azure. The identity need to be created by the user upfront (manually, other tooling, ...). Gardener/Azure Extension will only use the referenced one and won't create an identity. Furthermore the identity have to be in the same subscription as the Shoot cluster. Via the `identity.acrAccess` you can configure the worker machines to use the passed identity for pulling from an [Azure Container Registry (ACR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro).
**Caution:** Adding, exchanging or removing the identity will require a rolling update of all worker machines in the Shoot cluster.

Apart from the VNet and the worker subnet the Azure extension will also create a dedicated resource group, route tables, security groups, and an availability set (if not using zoned clusters).

### InfrastructureConfig with dedicated subnets per zone

Another deployment option **for zonal clusters only**, is to create and configure a separate subnet per availability zone. This network layout is recommended to users that require fine-grained control over their network setup. One prevalent usecase is to create a zone-redundant NAT Gateway deployment by taking advantage of the ability to deploy separate NAT Gateways for each subnet.

To use this configuration the following requirements must be met:

- the `zoned` field must be set to `true`.
- the `networks.vnet` section must not be empty and must contain a valid configuration. For existing clusters that were not using the `networks.vnet` section, it is enough if `networks.vnet.cidr` field is set to the current `networks.worker` value.

For each of the target zones a subnet CIDR range must be specified. The specified CIDR range must be contained in the VNet CIDR specified above, or the VNet CIDR of your already existing VNet. In addition, the CIDR ranges must not overlap with the ranges of the other subnets.

_ServiceEndpoints_ and _NatGateways_ can be configured per subnet. Respectively, when `networks.zones` is specified, the fields `networks.workers`, `networks.serviceEndpoints` and `networks.natGateway` cannot be set. All the configuration for the subnets must be done inside the respective zone's configuration.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: InfrastructureConfig
networks:
  zoned: true
  vnet: # specify either 'name' and 'resourceGroup' or 'cidr'
    cidr: 10.250.0.0/16
  zones:
  - name: 1
    cidr: "10.250.0.0/24"
  - name: 2
    cidr: "10.250.0.0/24"
    natGateway:
      enabled: false
```

### Migrating to zonal shoots with dedicated subnets per zone

For existing zonal clusters it is possible to migrate to a network layout with dedicated subnets per zone. The migration works by creating additional network resources as specified in the configuration and progressively roll part of your existing nodes to use the new resources. To achieve the controlled rollout of your nodes, parts of the existing infrastructure must be preserved which is why the following constraint is imposed:

One of your specified zones must have the exact same CIDR range as the current `network.workers` field. Here is an example of such migration:

```yaml
infrastructureConfig:
  apiVersion: azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
  kind: InfrastructureConfig
  networks:
    vnet:
      cidr: 10.250.0.0/16
    workers: 10.250.0.0/19
  zoned: true
```

to

```yaml
infrastructureConfig:
  apiVersion: azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
  kind: InfrastructureConfig
  networks:
    vnet:
      cidr: 10.250.0.0/16
    zones:
      - name: 3
        cidr: 10.250.0.0/19 # note the preservation of the 'workers' CIDR
# optionally add other zones 
    # - name: 2  
    #   cidr: 10.250.32.0/19
    #   natGateway:
    #     enabled: true
  zoned: true
```

Another more advanced example with user-provided public IP addresses for the NAT Gateway and how it can be migrated: 

```yaml
infrastructureConfig:
  apiVersion: azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
  kind: InfrastructureConfig
  networks:
    vnet:
      cidr: 10.250.0.0/16
    workers: 10.250.0.0/19
    natGateway:
      enabled: true
      zone: 1
      ipAddresses:
        - name: pip1
          resourceGroup: group
          zone: 1
        - name: pip2
          resourceGroup: group
          zone: 1
  zoned: true
```

to

```yaml
infrastructureConfig:
  apiVersion: azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
  kind: InfrastructureConfig
  zoned: true
  networks:
    vnet:
      cidr: 10.250.0.0/16
    zones:
      - name: 1
        cidr: 10.250.0.0/19 # note the preservation of the 'workers' CIDR
        natGateway:
          enabled: true
          ipAddresses:
            - name: pip1
              resourceGroup: group
              zone: 1
            - name: pip2
              resourceGroup: group
              zone: 1
# optionally add other zones 
#     - name: 2  
#       cidr: 10.250.32.0/19
#       natGateway:
#         enabled: true
#         ipAddresses:
#           - name: pip3
#             resourceGroup: group
```

You can apply such change to your shoot by issuing a `kubectl patch` command to replace your current `.spec.provider.infrastructureConfig` section:

```
$ cat new-infra.json

[
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/spec/provider/infrastructureConfig",
    "value": {
      "apiVersion": "azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1",
      "kind": "InfrastructureConfig",
      "networks": {
        "vnet": {
          "cidr": "<your-vnet-cidr>"
        },
        "zones": [
          {
            "name": 1,
            "cidr": "10.250.0.0/24",
            "natGateway": {
              "enabled": true
            }
          },
          {
            "name": 1,
            "cidr": "10.250.1.0/24",
            "natGateway": {
              "enabled": true
            }
          },
        ]
      },
      "zoned": true
    }
  }
]

kubectl patch --type="json" --patch-file new-infra.json shoot <my-shoot>
```

:warning: The migration to shoots with dedicated subnets per zone is a one-way process. Reverting the shoot to the previous configuration is not supported.

:warning: During the migration a subset of the nodes will be rolled to the new subnets.

## `ControlPlaneConfig`

The control plane configuration mainly contains values for the Azure-specific control plane components.
Today, the only component deployed by the Azure extension is the `cloud-controller-manager`.

An example `ControlPlaneConfig` for the Azure extension looks as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: ControlPlaneConfig
cloudControllerManager:
# featureGates:
#   SomeKubernetesFeature: true
```

The `cloudControllerManager.featureGates` contains a map of explicitly enabled or disabled feature gates.
For production usage it's not recommend to use this field at all as you can enable alpha features or disable beta/stable features, potentially impacting the cluster stability.
If you don't want to configure anything for the `cloudControllerManager` simply omit the key in the YAML specification.

`storage` contains options for storage-related control plane component. 
`storage.managedDefaultStorageClass` is enabled by default and will deploy a `storageClass` and mark it as a default (via the `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` annotation)
`storage.managedDefaultVolumeSnapshotClass` is enabled by default and will deploy a `volumeSnapshotClass` and mark it as a default (via the `snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/is-default-classs` annotation)
In case you want to manage your own default `storageClass` or `volumeSnapshotClass` you need to disable the respective options above, otherwise reconciliation of the controlplane may fail.


## `WorkerConfig`

The Azure extension supports encryption for volumes plus support for additional data volumes per machine.
Please note that you cannot specify the `encrypted` flag for Azure disks as they are encrypted by default/out-of-the-box.
For each data volume, you have to specify a name.
The following YAML is a snippet of a `Shoot` resource:

```yaml
spec:
  provider:
    workers:
    - name: cpu-worker
      ...
      volume:
        type: Standard_LRS
        size: 20Gi
      dataVolumes:
      - name: kubelet-dir
        type: Standard_LRS
        size: 25Gi
```

Additionally, it supports for other Azure-specific values and could be configured under `.spec.provider.workers[].providerConfig`

An example `WorkerConfig` for the Azure extension looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: WorkerConfig
nodeTemplate: # (to be specified only if the node capacity would be different from cloudprofile info during runtime)
  capacity:
    cpu: 2
    gpu: 1
    memory: 50Gi
diagnosticsProfile:
  enabled: true
  # storageURI: https://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/
```

The `.nodeTemplate` is used to specify resource information of the machine during runtime. This then helps in Scale-from-Zero. 
Some points to note for this field:
- Currently only cpu, gpu and memory are configurable.
- a change in the value lead to a rolling update of the machine in the worker pool
- all the resources needs to be specified

The `.diagnosticsProfile` is used to enable [machine boot diagnostics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/boot-diagnostics) (disabled per default).
A storage account is used for storing vm's boot console output and screenshots.
If `.diagnosticsProfile.StorageURI` is not specified azure managed storage will be used (recommended way).

## CSI volume provisioners

Every Azure shoot cluster will be deployed with the Azure Disk CSI driver and the Azure File CSI driver.

## Kubernetes Versions per Worker Pool

This extension supports `gardener/gardener`'s `WorkerPoolKubernetesVersion` feature gate, i.e., having [worker pools with overridden Kubernetes versions](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/8a9c88866ec5fce59b5acf57d4227eeeb73669d7/example/90-shoot.yaml#L69-L70) since `gardener-extension-provider-azure@v1.25`.

## Shoot CA Certificate and `ServiceAccount` Signing Key Rotation

This extension supports `gardener/gardener`'s `ShootCARotation` and `ShootSARotation` feature gates since `gardener-extension-provider-azure@v1.28`.

## Miscellaneous

### Azure Accelerated Networking

All worker machines of the cluster will be automatically configured to use [Azure Accelerated Networking](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli) if the prerequisites are fulfilled.
The prerequisites are that the cluster must be zoned, and the used machine type and operating system image version are compatible for Accelerated Networking.
`Availability Set` based shoot clusters will not be enabled for accelerated networking even if the machine type and operating system support it, this is necessary because all machines from the availability set must be scheduled on special hardware, more daitls can be found [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/10536).
Supported machine types are listed in the CloudProfile in `.spec.providerConfig.machineTypes[].acceleratedNetworking` and the supported operating system image versions are defined in `.spec.providerConfig.machineImages[].versions[].acceleratedNetworking`.

### Preview: Shoot clusters with VMSS Flexible Orchestration (VMSS Flex/VMO)

The machines of an Azure cluster can be created while being attached to an [Azure Virtual Machine ScaleSet with flexible orchestraion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-orchestration-modes#scale-sets-with-flexible-orchestration).
The Virtual Machine ScaleSet with flexible orchestration feature is currently in preview and not yet general available on Azure.
Subscriptions need to [join the preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-orchestration-modes#register-for-flexible-orchestration-mode) to make use of the feature.

Azure VMSS Flex is intended to replace Azure AvailabilitySet for non-zoned Azure Shoot clusters in the mid-term (once the feature goes GA) as VMSS Flex come with less disadvantages like no blocking machine operations or compability with `Standard` SKU loadbalancer etc.

To configure an Azure Shoot cluster which make use of VMSS Flex you need to do the following:
- The `InfrastructureConfig` of the Shoot configuration need to contain `.zoned=false`
- Shoot resource need to have the following annotation assigned: `alpha.azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/vmo=true`

Some key facts about VMSS Flex based clusters:
- Unlike regular non-zonal Azure Shoot clusters, which have a primary AvailabilitySet which is shared between all machines in all worker pools of a Shoot cluster, a VMSS Flex based cluster has an own VMSS for each workerpool
- In case the configuration of the VMSS will change (e.g. amount of fault domains in a region change; configured in the CloudProfile) all machines of the worker pool need to be rolled
- It is not possible to migrate an existing primary AvailabilitySet based Shoot cluster to VMSS Flex based Shoot cluster and vice versa
- VMSS Flex based clusters are using `Standard` SKU LoadBalancers instead of `Basic` SKU LoadBalancers for AvailabilitySet based Shoot clusters
